## Part 1

**Remarks (optional):** <!-- I found the program hard to navigate — even navigating the help menu was difficult. It was slow to have to move the cursor to scroll down a page as opposed to scrolling with my mouse. I also found it frustrating when I would mess up and have to quit the emulator entirely — this was not a forgiving program to interact with in that sense. -->

## Part 2

### Q1 (Chosen experience)

<!-- My experience is focused on the online game Poptropica.  -->

### Q2 (Difficulties)

<!-- When I visited poptropica.com for the first time in several years, I was surprised to find that it had been moved to the CoolMath Games website. I soon learned from the FAQ page that after the discontinuation of Flash, Poptropica had migrated to Coolmath Games because the latter website had offered to cover the ongoing costs and hosting of the game to sustain it going forward. When I attempted to log into my old account from middle school, I was unable to. I turned to the Internet for help and learned from a reddit thread that all accounts were deleted after 6 months of inactivity. It was a bummer that all my progress in the game was lost! Otherwise, the CoolMath Games website was easy to navigate and features blog posts about how to play Poptropica that was helpful for a new player as well as posts about new features that were helpful for a returning player that was re-acclimating to the game.

### Q3 (Resources for preservation)

* Were you able to recreate your experience? <!-- Yes. -->

* Response:

<!-- I was able to recreate my experience, though not entirely. When I had logged into the game with my new game, I was sad to find the islands I remembered playing the most when I was a child were no longer on the platform. In 2019, Poptropica had made the decision to remove 30 “old school islands” from the map because they were built using ActionScript 2 and they are causing a lot of problems for players. Poptropica had mentioned intentions to bring them back when the game is no longer in Flash but have not followed on that end. I discovered on a Reddit thread that people were able to return to the old islands by (i) purchasing the game on Steam or (ii) downloading Flashpoint and the old AS2 version game zip file that can be found online. The download steps were clearly outlined and not too convoluted but I decided to not download the game myself as I felt unsafe after reading the Reddit responses from other users. Many users were experiencing issues with the download and still were unable to access the old islands. They described that only the new islands were present. 

I stayed with the Coolmath Games version and found that the game was a lot different from what I had remembered. When creating my new account, I was unable to customize my character, I was only given a selection of pre-made characters and had to choose one from the bunch. I really enjoyed the ability to customize my character in the old game and being able to give my character crazy haircuts! I noticed that the website contained a lot of ads and they would pop up as I was navigating from one location to another. For me, the frequent ads disrupted the playing experience and the game was no longer as immersive as I remembered it being. There were also a lot of notifications within the game that encouraged me to buy game credits, which again robbed me of enjoyment of the game. Additionally, the site also now contained a lot of hints and suggestions on what to do next. I remember part of the fun of the game was figuring out the puzzle of the islands with friends so the hints made for a different playing experience than the one I remembered. It made the game easier to play and in a way, it became less fun to play.

### Q4 (Benefits of preservation)

<!-- I don’t believe there is substantial benefit in preserving my childhood experience with Poptropica. While I greatly enjoyed the game as a child and have fond memories of playing it, simply holding onto those positive memories is enough for me personally. Poptropica was meaningful to me but it was ultimately just one of many online games from the era I was growing up in. Its cultural and historical significance in the grand scheme of things is relatively minor. There may be some value in preserving representative examples of early 21st century children’s online games as part of the broader digital record, but I don’t think the specific effort required to maintain Poptropica in its original form are completely necessary. The technical challenges of keeping old software running and the labor involved in accruing it would be quite costly. Those resources are probably better spent preserving digital content that have clearer historical importance. And while having access to older games is nice for nostalgia purposes, realistically only a small number of people would likely make use of it. So while I am glad people are working to preserve the game, I don’t feel convinced that Poptropica rises to the level of warranting comprehensive preservation. The memories will live on regardless! -->

## Part 3

### Q5 (Comparing with other forms of preservation) 

<!-- Software preservation is different from other forms of preservation because software itself is not a tangible object the way art or architecture is. The process of software preservation is therefore less physical. And unlike art or architecture that will degrade over time due to exposure to the environment conditions such that conservation involves lengthening the natural progression of decay, software does not deteriorate in quality (it just becomes supplanted by new software) so software preservation is less about restoring software to what the developer intended like how artifact preservationists may want to maintain the condition of an object as close to its original state as possible over an extended period, preserving software just means maintaining a method to be able to run the software. The standards for software preservation should also be similar to those of the other media such as the Film Registry wherein a small amount of culturally or historically significant software is kept. The goals should be similar to those defined in the NPS guide such as keeping the existing form and maintaining integrity. However, unlike film and art, software is less representative of the culture that uses it and more representative of what tools society needed at the time, therefore I suspect very few software actually meets the cut for being culturally or historically significant so we do not need super strict or detailed preservation guidelines on what to do other than maintaining the source code and a method of running the software. -->

### Q6 (Legal protections and obligation to pay)

* Individual response: 

<!-- There should be legal protections for individuals working with software from companies that no longer exist. In such cases, as the original developers can no longer profit from the software, there should be no legal ramifications for using or providing that software for public download. For other situations, like older Windows versions, standard copyright laws should still apply, as they already protect various media forms and creating new laws specifically for software is unnecessary. Under these regulations, software preservationists would have the freedom to use the software as they see fit once the creators/owners' copyright expires. Consequently, if the owner's copyright remains valid, people are obligated to pay for the software, as the company or individual owning it may still profit from it. However, if the owning entity is no longer in existence or chooses to relinquish the copyright, the obligation to pay should be waived. Thus, extending this reasoning, distributing legacy software is considered piracy if the copyright-owning entity still exists and benefits from the software's distribution. Once the copyright expires or the owning entity no longer exists, efforts to distribute the legacy software would be considered preservation. -->

* Discussion with partner: 

<!-- We came to a consensus! I agreed with my partner’s claim that if preservation could bypass copyright laws under the guide of preservation, it would harm the interests of the creators of the software and potentially discourage future innovation. They brought up the example of Nintendo to support their claim, they argue that the copyright laws on Nintendo games has allowed it to generate revenue that has been supportive of continuous innovation. I agree with this and also think that the websites that are hosting old Nintendo games don’t really feel like preservation because it feels as though they are just a way for people to download games for free. We believe that when the user is getting something out of the old legacy software, that is larger than just preservation value -  such as enjoyment of a fun gaming experience - they should pay. And attempts to make this software widely available for use would be piracy However, in other cases, when users are not deriving much value from this software or the company developed it no longer exists, then you don’t have an obligation to pay.  -->

### Q7 (Expensive taste vs public good)

* Individual response: 
<!-- I strongly believe that software preservation is an expensive taste. I struggle to see the benefit of preserving software such as WordPerfect when the majority of the US population will never use it again. And if the majority of people in the US won’t benefit from the software being preserved, I do not see substantial value in preserving it. Additionally, software preservation takes time and funding away from more pressing software matters. For example, many people cannot use current word-processors like Google Docs because of accessibility barriers. I think it is more valuable to focus on making today’s software accessible to all users than preserving software of the past. To underscore this point, consider the fact that lawyers, who are among the highest-paid professionals in the US, have a preference for WordPerfect because it enhances their productivity (and therefore likely helps them earn more money). Meanwhile, a single parent raising a child in a low-income family may struggle to afford a Microsoft Word license or the internet connection required to use Google Docs. This disparity demonstrates how much of an expensive taste software preservation is. We should focus our time on making today’s software accessible to all as opposed to catering to a small, affluent group of people who can afford to preserve the software on their own. -->

* Response to partner: 

<!-- My partner made the argument that preserving legacy software is important because it captures technological access and cultural heritage of the times in which it was created. They argued that retaining access to things like early user interfaces and class video games allows future generations to study how technology and popular tastes evolved. Preservation also enables legacy software to serve as a valuable teaching tool. They believe that students and researchers can refer to real examples to better understand the history of programming, design principles, and computing concepts. Keeping this software available contributes to society’s shared knowledge that everyone can learn from. In this way, access to software from the past can inspire continued innovation. Studying what had come before allows developers to learn from the successes and failures of the past and apply those learning to create improved modern software. 

While I agree with them that legacy software can be beneficial for offering education and inspirational value, I think its benefits do not outweigh its costs. As hardware and operating systems evolve, it may become increasingly difficult and resource-intensive to keep legacy software running. These high costs raise questions about whether it is a wise use of limited resources, especially if the software may only appeal to a relatively niche audience. I also do not think the benefits are widespread enough for legacy software to be considered a public good. The majority of people are unlikely to ever directly study or use most legacy software and I would also argue these educational insights are already being passed down in textbooks and other educational materials without the need for extensive preservation measures. Additionally, while legacy software may inspire innovation, I believe that truly groundbreaking progress more often comes from new approaches rather than rehashing old ones. Therefore, focusing excessive resources on preserving the past could divert attention from investing in the cutting-edge technologies of the present and the future.
