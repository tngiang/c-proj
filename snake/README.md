1. Consortium was founded by Xerox employee Joe Becker along with Apple employees Lee Collins and Mark Davis in the 1980s. The Consortium's current members include major technology companies such as Google and Microsoft, governments such as those of India and Bangladesh, and research instiutitons such as the University of California, Berkeley. With many major technology companies as members, this could affect decisions being made for Unicode in that decisions will be made in effort to support compatibility with many operating systems and internet aplications. Additionally, due to the fact that many of the technology companies are US-based, this may influence decisions towards scripts that are of particular importance to the digital marketplace over other languages and scripts worldwide. 

2. A language that was missing important characters was the Vietnamese script. The Vietnamese contains character (like Ư and Đ) which are not found in the standard Latin alphabet. When early encoding systems did not fully support these characters, it caused confusion and miscommunication for users. It made it dififcult for Vietnamese speakers to communicate on digital platforms and therefore to preserve their cultural identity online. 

3. a. I think Han unification is a flawed attempt at streamlining character encoding. While the Han root character might be consistent across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the actual glyphs commonly used across the writing systems may not be and it is unfair to priortize one linguistic tradition over another. Han unification has effectively flattened important nuances in writing styles for the sake of efficiency. 

The Han unification has also had implications for users in terms of readability of characters and aesthetic preferences. These factors should not be disreagarded as it may result in the marginalziation of certian linguistic and cultural identity for the sake of uniform encoding.

b. We started off by taking turns representing our positions. Then, we started with criticizing each other’s arguments. We had a point of confusion about if the same encoding can have different glyphs–and it can. We looked up the different Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese glyphs for the same encoding, and they all looked very similar. This prioritizes efficiency, sustainability, and memory usage. However, there is a case to be made that using the same encoding reinforces the dominance of Chinese culture, and erases the meaningful linguistic and cultural context of each language, including its writing style. It also presumes that in the future, all these languages will continue to write the character in the same way.
